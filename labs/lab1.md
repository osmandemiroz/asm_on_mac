## [cite_start]Objective(s) [cite: 4]
* [cite_start]Become familiar with addressing modes and memory operations in 8086 emulator software. [cite: 6]

## [cite_start]Lab Task [cite: 5]
[cite_start]Write a program that writes 8 fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 13) to memory by using Register Indirect Addressing. [cite: 7]

[cite_start]Store your numbers at memory addresses from DS:2600h to DS:2607h. [cite: 8] [cite_start]In the end, your memory must look like this: [cite: 8]

* [cite_start]DS: 2600h [cite: 9] [cite_start]00 [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]DS: 2601h [cite: 11] [cite_start]01 [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]DS: 2602h [cite: 13] [cite_start]01 [cite: 14]
* [cite_start]DS: 2603h [cite: 15] [cite_start]02 [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]DS: 2604h [cite: 17] [cite_start]03 [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]DS: 2605h [cite: 19] [cite_start]05 [cite: 20]
* [cite_start]DS: 2606h [cite: 21] [cite_start]08 [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]DS: 2607h [cite: 23] [cite_start]13 [cite: 24]

## [cite_start]Evaluation [cite: 25]
[cite_start]You must complete your work until lab hour. [cite: 26] [cite_start]You will be evaluated during the lab session. [cite: 26]
[cite_start]Your code should not contain any comment lines. [cite: 27]

[cite_start]**NOTE:** Students who do not submit their assignments through the ESTUOYS system will be graded with 0 (zero) points. [cite: 28]
[cite_start]Late submissions will not be accepted. [cite: 29]
